--num_of_topology   							num of msas that you want to simulate
--taxa_num 										how many taxas you want to have in the final tree
--range_of_taxa_num  							the taxas of the big tree that you want to sample the final tree from  attention: the lower bound of it should >= taxa_num
--len_of_msa_upper_bound						the upper bound of msa length
--len_of_msa_lower_bound 						the lower bound of msa length
--num_of_process 								the processes that you use to accelerate the simulation
--distribution_of_internal_branch_length 		like '[a,b,c]' if a==0 will use uniform(b,c) if a==1 will use gamma(b,c)
--distribution_of_external_branch_length		usage the same as --distribution_of_internal_branch_length 
--range_of_mean_pairwise_divergence				the range of expected mean pairwise divergence
--range_of_indel_substitution_rate				the range of indel substitution rate
--max_indel_length								the maximum of indel length in the msa
