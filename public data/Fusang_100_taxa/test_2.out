Option -T does not have any effect with the sequential or parallel MPI version.
It is used to specify the number of threads for the Pthreads-based parallelization

RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 348 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 349 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 350 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 351 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 3351 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data
IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 3352 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 6 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
undetermined columns removed is printed to file ./simulation/fasta_file/t_sim1_TRUE.fas.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 6 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
